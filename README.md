# Sensors-Projects

This repository gathers projects, laboratory exercises, simulations, and assignments centered around **sensors and actuators** within automation and control systems.  
You will find code, schematics, documentation, and simulation files that explore how sensors and actuators integrate into industrial and academic setups.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Below is a suggested structure and explanation of the common folders and files you may find:

Here‚Äôs what each is typically used for:

| Folder / File | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Cadesimu/** | Logic / digital simulations built with Cadesimu, showing how sensors and actuators behave in combinational or sequential logic circuits. |
| **Fluidsimu/** | Simulations in FluidSIM (or similar) for pneumatic and hydraulic systems. Includes sensor-actuator feedback loops. |
| **LabCableada/** | Exercises and diagrams where sensor-actuator logic is implemented in a wired (relay / hardwired) form. |
| **Studio5000/** | PLC programs developed in Studio 5000 (Allen Bradley) using Ladder logic to interface with sensors and actuators. |
| **Practica_de_Laboratorio2__Sensores_y_actuadores.pdf** | Laboratory report including objectives, methodology, results and analysis of sensor / actuator experiments. |
| **Tarea3_sensores.xlsx** | Excel file with exercises, data tables, calculations and graphs related to sensors. |
| **Tarea4__Sensores_y_actuadores.pdf** | Theoretical and practical assignment on actuators: operation, control, and integration. |

## üîç Topics Covered

Some of the core concepts addressed across the projects include:

- Sensor types (proximity, limit switches, analog sensors, etc.)  
- Actuator control (motors, solenoids, pneumatic cylinders)  
- Signal interfacing (digital vs analog, signal conditioning)  
- Control logic design (wired logic, ladder logic, PLC control)  
- Simulation tools (logic simulators, fluid/ pneumatic simulators)  
- Integration of sensors & actuators in automation systems  
- Documentation and analysis of experimental results
